Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation was an absolute joke. The plot was underdeveloped, the characters were not amusing, the fart jokes weren’t funny, and although it moved fast, it was still extremely boring. Most children over 11 will very easily realize the amazingly large and dull plot holes, and frankly, this movie is for kids younger than 11. It follows Dracula and his family as they go on a monster cruise, departing from Budapest. It turns out that the human host of the cruise, Ericka, actually hates monsters, and she especially hates Dracula, trying to kill him throughout the movie. However, Dracula actually has a large crush on her. After his wife’s death, he was extremely lonely. He fell for her, and throughout many awkward moments, this is obviously shown. She then goes down to a secret room in the cruise ship where she meets Abraham Van Helsing, the main villain of some of the other Hotel Transylvania movies. He is revealed to be his great-grandfather and is nearly completely running on machine power, only his head being human. Van Helsing has a plan to eliminate all monsters at the cruise’s final destination, the lost city of Atlantis. It is using an Instrument of Destruction, which can be found in the ruins of Atlantis. Although Abraham makes Ericka promise that she won’t attempt to assassinate Dracula, she still makes multiple repeated but unsuccessful attempts. After, Dracula’s friends hear about Ericka’s inability to “get him” and since they had no context they assumed that she had a crush on him as well. After they dine on a deserted island, she sets a trap by putting garlic (he is garlic-intolerant) in guacamole, but also unexpectedly begins to fall for him. After, they realize the garlic was in the guacamole and instantly became suspicious of her motives, which is one of the big plot holes. They jumped to a big assumption out of literally nowhere, which left me wondering, “Why?” I can slightly see why they may want to assume this, but it makes almost no sense. The ship then reaches Atlantis which was converted into a casino. She sees Ericka enter an underground area, and Dracula follows her, with his daughter not far behind. With Dracula’s help she avoids the booby traps laid all across the area and escapes. After Ericka is told that Drac has a crush on her, she rejects him. After, Ericka gives Van Helsing the object- albeit regretfully- and he uses it. The instrument ends up actually being a case for an obviously old music sheet, and he plays a song in it with a modern synthesizer. This particularly confused me- why is this electronic music so old? Electronics didn’t even exist at the time the sheet music appeared to have been created- much less dubstep.¨ The music wakes up a friendly Kraken that lived near and it started to attack the monsters. Dracula tries to stop it and gets injured, and Ericka saves Dracula. She then confesses her love for Dracula, and pleads with Abraham to stop. This infuriates him, and he attacks them both. To try to stop the music, Dracula’s son takes out a portable DJ kit and plays more positive music like “Don’t Worry, Be Happy,” to attempt to “out-song” Abraham’s song. After he plays the Maracrena, the Kraken is relaxed and happy, and Abraham is unable to counter it. When Van Helsing starts to dance, he slips and falls, but Dracula saves him. Van Helsing apologizes to the monsters and gives each of them a full refund for the cruise, and sends them back. At Hotel Transylvania, Dracula proposes to Ericka, who agrees, and it just ends like that. When it ended, I was wondering how the main villain for most if not all of the Hotel Transylvania movies transformed just like that. It felt almost disappointing, like they had somehow reached some budget limit and just decided to end the movie right there. The movie felt like the younger brother of its other 2 editions- a lot less amusing, more confusing, and just overall a terrible movie. In maturity level from Kindergarten to 12th grade, I would rate Hotel Transylvania 3 a 2nd  grade. The jokes are funny for 2nd graders, the plot doesn’t irk 2nd graders, and 2nd graders are probably the oldest kids  that will enjoy this movie.
