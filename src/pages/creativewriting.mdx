## Creative Writing Assignment: Chapter 157 of Boku no Hero Academia <br/>

Eri fell into Midoriya Izuku’s arms, desperate to be saved. Saved from Chisaki and the Eight Precepts, whose only goal was to use her as a tool. A tool to wipe out heroes from the world, a tool to disable the quirks that had allowed heroes- and villains- to stream into Japan and the rest of the world. Eri had the unique power through her quirk to permanently remove quirks from anyone, and this was perfect for Chisaki and his villain group, the Eight Precepts, who desired the power that came with Eri’s quirk. <br/>
“This time… I’m not letting go of you!” Izuku screamed as he held onto Eri with all of his might. 
“GIVE HER BACK!” Chisaki screamed as he leaped across, trying to grasp Eri. His plan was on the verge of destruction as his main asset was being carried away by a dorky high-school student. He couldn’t believe it.<br/>
“Not good…! I can’t move well suspended in midair like this!” Izuku thought as Chisaki’s hand was only a few feet from Eri’s long hair, ready to snatch her out of his hands. <br/>
“I WON’T LET GO! NO MATTER WHAT! I’M NOT GONNA LET ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPEN AGAIN!” He recalled previous moments, when Eri had been put back into the hands of Chisaki and his group. <br/>
 Midoriya called back to mind when Mirio, one of the best students at U.A., his prestigious high school created to help children become heroes, asked him a question.  <br/>
“What kind of hero do you want to be? Tell me.” 
“I want to be the kind of hero that wipes away everyone’s worries, always wins, and saves everyone!” He thought of All Might, the previous #1 hero, the Symbol of Peace, the one who wiped away everyone’s worries, always won, and saved everyone. He was the one who let everyone sleep peacefully from the villains consistently plaguing the world. And he had passed down his quirk to Midoriya Izuku, a previously quirk-less child who wanted, more than anything, to be a hero. One for All was the only quirk that could be passed down from person to person, and All Might, the true hero, the Symbol of Peace, a previously quirk-less individual, had passed down his quirk, one of the most powerful quirks, to him. To a dorky high-schooler. A dorky high-schooler with a dream to become the best hero, the one to let Japan, and the world, sleep safely.  <br/>
Izuku yelled as he activated his quirk, One for All, powerful motivation flowing through his veins. Chisaki used his makeshift weapon that he had created by disassembling people in his villain group (his quirk was used to disassemble and reassemble anything,) and reassembling them into an extremely powerful and large machine that battled with Chisaki and made him a formidable opponent. The aim for his tough weapon was none other than Midoriya Izuku.  <br/>
Izuku was in the air, fighting Chisaki with all of his strength. He wasn’t worried about the bodily harm that having One for All that powerful could be. It could turn every one of his limbs purple and break each one of them. It had happened before; the tradeoff of his extreme power. For better or worse, he wasn’t focused on that. The only thing that he was trained on was keeping Eri at his side, saving her from the monstrosity that was Chisaki. He launched at one of the arms of Chisaki’s monster of a weapon, and it slashed off. Chisaki was in shock as he saw, right before his eyes, one of the most powerful things he’d ever been able to fight with just destroyed.  <br/>
Izuku was about to kick Chisaki. Right as he was about to kick him, he got blown all the way up into the sky, and as he fell from the sky, the only thing he was still holding onto was a mortified Eri. As he dropped, he thought to himself. <br/>
“ Did I just travel through the air at high speed using wind pressure…? Like All Might’s New Hampshire Smash? Could I have lost control like I did when I fought Bakugo, all those years ago?” He recalled an old battle from the early days of high school.  <br/>
“So, basically…” He thought of the intense injuries he had probably suffered.  <br/>
“My legs are- !” In surprise, he looked down. It was like a miracle. He had suffered no damage from the intense fighting.  <br/>
The other high school heroes from U.A. who were sent in to help fight, looked up.  <br/>
“What the hell was that… A shockwave…?” They all inquired.  <br/>
“Eri…! You can’t leave! You… belong to ME!” Chisaki screamed.  <br/>

“My body feels hot… no, it’s cold. Even though I just used 100% of my power just now!” A shocked Izuku wondered why he hadn’t suffered any damage at all from his power run.  <br/>
“Nothing’s broken! Better yet… All my injuries have been healed..!” He looked down as even his previous injuries from using One for All had been healed. Even his minor scrapes were gone. He was revitalized.  <br/>
Midoriya looked at Eri, who was sweating furiously.  <br/>
“Is that… your power?” He asked of her. But a new feeling was coming. <br/>
“What the- ?! Now it feels like- my body is being pulled apart from the inside…!” Izuku had no idea what was happening, or what Eri’s power was. He only knew how he felt. Then, Chisaki came onto the scene. <br/>
“She’s unable to control her power. By some chance, she was able to activate it, but… you don’t know how to stop it, do you, Eri?!” Chisaki asked Eri and informed Midoriya about his power.  <br/>
“With Eri’s quirk, she can rewind humans. Depending on how she uses it, she can probably revert a person to a monkey, if she tried. If you continue to hold her like that, you’ll disappear. She can rewind anything she touches to nothingness. That quirk of hers is… cursed.” Chisaki revealed everything about Eri’s quirk to Izuku. <br/>
“Return her to me. There’s no way to stop her other than my disassembly.” Chisaki asked for Eri back, again. <br/>
“I won’t. No matter what.” Izuku stayed firm. <br/>
“I see… the instant my leg broke… before I could even feel pain, she reverted it for me. It’s such a kind, gentle quirk.” Midoriya continued talking, reflecting on what had happened. It all finally made sense to him.  <br/>
“Now that I’ve experienced how it feels, I understand…! She continues to revert my body with blinding speed… In that case, if I’m constantly accumulating grave injuries at an even greater speed…” Motivation was back in for Izuku as he realized that with Eri by his side, he could fight with all the power he had.  <br/>
He activated his 100% power, fighting with all of his power. <br/>
“Eri, will you lend me a hand?” <br/>
